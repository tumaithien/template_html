  must renew it. This online visa is one-of-a-kind and can only be linked to

  their passport after applying for the e-visa, they should be aware that the
  old passport cannot be used with the new one.

  for payment has previously been authorized for online payments. Finally,
  they should be aware that the Rwandan government will issue the approved
  e-visa as well as all communications via email, so they should register
  with a frequently used email address.

  When approved, the Rwandan e-Visa is electronically linked to the
  traveler's passport and emailed to the traveler. It is necessary to print
  the e-Visa in order to present it to border officials in Rwanda for
