<p>When it comes down to choosing a provider, it is important to look at the cost and speed it takes to receive the
    fund. Normally lower fees means longer transfer and vice versa. So it is important to balance between the two that
    works for you. And just to keep in mind, DNBC can offer low fees and fast transfers for most transactions to India.

    and taxed accordingly. If you are a business receiving the funds, you are not taxed on the amount received but on
    the profits of the business.</p>
